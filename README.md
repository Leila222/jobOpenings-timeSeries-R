# Time Series Data Analysis on Job Openings in the USA
This project explores and analyzes job openings trends in the United States using time series data and statistical tools in **R**. 
Through data visualization, decomposition, modeling the different components and forecasting models, the goal is to derive insights into the patterns and behaviors of the evolution of job openings over time.

## Technologies Used

- **R**
- **ggplot2** – for visualizations  
- **forecast** – for forcasting future values 
- **tseries** – for statistical testing  
- **dplyr, tidyr** – for data wrangling
  
## Files Included
